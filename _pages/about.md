Hi! I am Kang Li, now I am a PhD candidate of **Civil Engineering in Tongji University**, and I am going to get my PhD degree in 2025. To let you know me better, I have made this webpage to show the information about my basic situation, research field, research results, etc. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me through the content of my academic homepage, and I am looking forward to your communication.

Education background and work experience
------
I entered the [University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB)](https://www.ustb.edu.cn/) in 2014 to study in Mineral Resources Engineering (Excellence Program), received my Bachelor's degree in 2018, and was qualified to be guaranteed for graduate school with the first overall major, continued to study for a Master's degree in Mining Engineering at USTB, and received my Master's degree ahead of schedule in June 2020 due to my academic achievements, and started to enter the civil engineering at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in 2021 to pursue a PhD degree. 

During my undergraduate years, I traveled to [Central South University] (https://www.csu.edu.cn/) for a half-year visit and also to the [National University of Science and Technology MISIS](https://misis.ru/) for a one-month visit.

From July to October 2020, I briefly worked as a Senior Investment Development Specialist in the North Jiangsu region of Country Garden Group for real estate investment.

Primary research interests
------
All along, my research focuses on the construction and safety monitoring of underground engineering, with my bachelor's thesis related to slope stabilization in open-pit mines, my master's thesis related to damage mechanism analysis and stabilization of mine shafts, and my PhD research is on the ground-penetrating radar non-destructive monitoring of shield tunnels and intelligent analysis of the data.

My doctoral research focused on non-destructive testing and intelligent applications for underground engineering structures. Specifically, I developed automated equipment equipped with GPR for the automatic monitoring of structures in shield tunnel construction and operation scenarios, while utilizing AI models for rapid and intelligent data analysis. I also contributed to the research on intelligent monitoring systems based on the 'cloud-edge-terminal' architecture and developed the [GPR-AI Master] (https://www.gprai.com.cn/), which is built on elastic server infrastructure of Alibaba Group.

Primary skills
------
* Programming skills: Python, Matlab.
* Softwares: gprMax, COMSOL, Rhino, 3DMAX, AutoCAD, Surfer, Plaxis, FLAC3D, PFC3D, ANSYS, Cyclone, etc.
* Language: Chinese (native), English CET-4 and CET-6, IELTS score: 6.5.
